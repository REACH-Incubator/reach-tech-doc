Overview of CERTH Blockchain as a Service (BaaS)
================================================

BaaS is a Blockchain solution which allows secure data transactions between Data Providers and Data Consumers, with a private Ethereum Blockchain with an aim to enable efficient permission management as regards the data of the users. Î¤he BaaS Platform stores datasets from CERTH (Data Provider) and every user that registers to the Platform, will act as a Data Consumer and will make requests to access the datasets available. Via the BaaS, the users' following functionalities are logged in the Blockchain as immutable transactions:

1. User Registration
2. User Login/Logout
3. User requests permissions to access data
4. User gives permissions to access their data
5. User updates the permissions to access their data. 

Getting access to the Infrastructure
------------------------------------

.. note:: To obtain access, contact us by mail (<krinidis@iti.gr>, <ggogos@iti.gr>) to the consortium address.

The access to the Platform will be made through the following steps:

1. Send e-mail to the following consortium addresses, providing an e-mail address for the registration.
2. A response will be sent to the provided address with a link to verify the e-mail.
3. After the verification of the address, the link will redirect the user to the registration page of the Platform.
4. After the registration, a link will be sent to the user's e-mail address, for the verification of the user which will redirect the user to the Login page of BaaS.

Within REACH, there is a need to establish an agreement between the sides of the data exchange and provide accountability and traceability. BaaS provides the basis for accountability since logging the data value chain interactions functionalities in the Blockchain in an immutable way, allows for accountability, auditability, and nonrepudiation of critical actions.

Data Sharing
------------

Through the Home Page of BaaS, the user will be able to see the available datasets provided to the Platform and make a request to the provider. The dataset page will provide information about the type of the data, the field of science (e.g. Medical & Health, Energy) and comments about their content. More information are provided in the Documentation of the CERTH Data Sharing Tool.

Trace transactions
------------------

BaaS features the view of historical transactions which addresses the REACH toolkit need for traceability of data transactions. The users of the BaaS can trace the transactions have been made and check the permissions they have on the requested datasets. A request will be made through the Platform for the dataset of interest. A notification will be sent to the data provider to accept or reject the request. The response will be sent back to the user and it will be stored in the Blockchain and in the transaction tracing menu.

Use case
--------

BaaS is adapted for the management and sharing of user data, and it uses a Blockchain network with deployed Solidity smart contracts that handle the permissions that the users (CERTH) of the platform give to other users. The purpose of this tool is to provide an easy step data sharing procedure (sharing, management, traceability), like other platforms, but with the integration of the security standards coming with the innovative Blockchain technology.
