Use Case
############

I am developing a blockchain-based solution. I need a multi-agent simulation tool to evaluate scalability, stability, performance, fairness, etc., as well as testing the adaptability features of my system, e.g. automatic and dynamic load balancing, elasticity and self-healing networks.

Scenario:

1.	The developer creates a simulation model in MAX,or may choose to customize a pre-existing model from a model library.
2.	She defines the properties she wants to simulate.
3.	She validates design hypothesis related to properties such as scalability, security and resilience, performance, and finding the right configuration for the design, such as the right parameter values.
